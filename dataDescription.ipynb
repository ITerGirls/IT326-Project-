This issue often stems from algorithms that fail to \naccurately personalize content based on individual user preferences, resulting in a mismatch between the content displayed and \nthe user's interests. As a result, users may become disenchanted with the platform, leading to reduced usage, loss of interest,\nor even abandonment.\n    \n-Our aim is to gauge users' interests and deliver content that suits their preferences, enhancing their overall experience on the platform. This involves analyzing their interactions and content consumption habits to customize the content they encounter. By understanding what users are interested in and how they interact with the platform, we can tailor the content to their preferences, ultimately making their experience more enjoyable.\n",
